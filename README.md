# Lobster-assigner

The goal of **Lobster-assigner** is to ensure reproducibility of the results obtained in a recent Erratum published in Molecular Ecology about the RAD sequencing data from the Benestan et al. paper (2015):

**RAD genotyping reveals fine-scale genetic structuring and provides powerful population assignment in a widely distributed marine species, the American lobster (Homarus americanus).**
