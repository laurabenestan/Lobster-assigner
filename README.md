# Lobster-assigner

The goal of Lobster-assigner is to help people to reproduce results obtained in a recent Erratum published in Molecular Ecology about the RAD sequencing data from the Benestan et al. paper (2015):

RAD genotyping reveals fine-scale genetic structuring and provides powerful population assignment in a widely distributed marine species, the American lobster (Homarus americanus).
